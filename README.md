Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a square matrix

• Aim of the project is implementing the normalized power iteration algorithm together with deflation to find two
eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvector for the dominant eigenvalue of a given matrix A, where A is a square matrix.

• The program takes three command line arguments for the parameters: Name of the .txt file which includes matrix A,
tolerance and name of the output file.

• To implement Object Oriented Programming, matrix class is defined. Entries of matrices are stored in dynamic 2-d
vector variable.

• Matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, transpose are defined as class methods.
